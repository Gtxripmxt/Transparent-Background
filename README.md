# Transparent Background

This mod removes stupid blue blending of background image and shitty yellow list background in several menu pages and let us able to enjoy the raw anime porn background we pick.

Will consider customizing the background color by your own or something else.
Welcome to report bugs anyway!

Transparent BG is by Naxrin, and Transparent List is by Lwhe.
Inspired by Alphalaneous' version, we made a fix.
https://github.com/Alphalaneous/Transparent-Lists
But we recommend his own Transparent List more.

Neither of us is pro coder, we do it just bcoz both fascinating thing is yet not published in Mega Hack v8 up to now.
Neither of us have a mac so this mod is not yet confirmed to work well in mac. Contact Naxrin via GD message if the mod breaks down on your mac.
